so for your information, to program the RGB led for the keyboard Keys..
the addresses for each line (it starts at the bottom right)
FEC0_1000 (Space bar line)
FEC0_1020
FEC0_1040
FEC0_1060
FEC0_1080 (Number Keys)
FEC0_10A0 (Function Keys)
the color information is in a 16bits Value
4 bits for R/G/B
[3:0] Blue
[7:4] Green
[11:8] Red
So, you will need write Shorts for every LED
There are 16 column and 6 Rows... Obviously there will be holes and the LED might not line up properly.
So, I was thinking that it would be sweet to have some kind of RGB testing sweeps at boot time.
